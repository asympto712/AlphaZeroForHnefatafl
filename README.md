# AlphaZeroForHnefatafl
Implementation of AlphaZero for Hnefatafl the board game (still in progress).

  ### The Progress thus far
The training structure should work, but we haven't succeeded in building a competitive model yet.


## How to run: 
  1. make your python venv (I used python3.11) 
  2. activate the venv 
  3. pip install torch, numpy, maturin, etc.. 
  4. (on your terminal) maturin develop 
  5. should get a _azhnefatafl.~.pdy file under src/azhnefatafl/ No need to call maturin build
