# AlphaZeroForHnefatafl
Implementation of AlphaZero for Hnefatafl the board game

(Still in progress..) (Updated 31.01)
How to run: make your python venv (I used python3.11) -> activate the venv -> pip install torch, numpy, maturin, etc.. -> (on your terminal) maturin develop -> should get a _azhnefatafl.~.pdy file under src/azhnefatafl/ No need to call maturin build
