# AlphaZeroForHnefatafl
Implementation of AlphaZero for Hnefatafl the board game

<<<<<<< HEAD
(Still in progress..) (Updated 31.01)
How to run: make your python venv (I used python3.11) -> activate the venv -> pip install torch, numpy, maturin, etc.. -> (on your terminal) maturin develop -> should get a _azhnefatafl.~.pdy file under src/azhnefatafl/ No need to call maturin build

How to run: make your python venv (I used python3.11) -> activate the venv -> pip install torch, numpy, maturin, etc.. -> (on your terminal) maturin build -> you should see 'wheels' directory under target/ -> copy the .whl file (exact names should vary depending on your environments) under azhnefatafl/ (DO NOT unzip it)
